    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Broth</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clean the meat: Add all meat to a stock pot and enough water to
            submerge it, bring to a boil. Drain and rinse thoroughly under
            running water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the meat, broth, lemongrass and onions to the pot and fill with
            water almost to the brim. Bring to a boil then drop the heat to
            medium-high to maintain a low boil. Add the seasoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let it simmer and periodically check the meats for doneness and
            remove them as they finish cooking. The pork should be done after
            about an hour, the beef can vary between 2-3 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            After all the meat has removed, let it cool, then slice it. Adjust
            seasoning and add water to the broth pot if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>Make the aromatics & coloring then add it to the pot.</li>
          <li>Boil noodles according to package instructions.</li>
          <li>
            Assemble your bowl, and serve with herbs and veg on a side platter.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Red Coloring & Aromatics</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sauté seeds in oil on medium heat until the seeds give up the bright
            red color, then remove the seeds.
          </li>
          <li>Add shallots and garlic, sauté until brown.</li>
          <li>Add all of this to the pot of broth for color.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Pork Blood (Huyet / Tiet) </b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The easiest thing to do is just buy it already cooked and boil just
            to heat it up. If you use the raw type like we did for this recipe,
            cut into 1″ cubes and boil for 30-45 minutes
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Banana Flowers</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prepare a bowl of about 2 cups of water, mixed with the juice of 1
            lemon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thinly slice the banana flower and add to the water mixture to sit
            for about 30 minutes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sate (Spicy Chille Condiment)</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Weigh out the dried Thai chiles, then soak in just enough warm water
            to cover the chiles for 20 minutes. Drain the water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add all sate ingredients to a pan on medium heat and stir
            continuously to brown, cook, and slightly reduce the chile paste,
            about 30-40 minutes. If at any point it becomes too dry, you can add
            more oil, up to 50% of the amount we started with. Taste and
            reseason with sugar or salt as desired. See photo for how the final
            product should look.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let cool and transfer to a sealed jar stored in the fridge . You can
            add ~2 tbsp of the final product to the soup pot for a boost in
            flavor and color, or simply and let each person add to their bowl to
            make it as spicy as they'd like!
          </li>
        </ul>
