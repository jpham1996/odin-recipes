    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Prep the protein</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In order to slice the beef, chicken or pork as thinly as possible, I
            recommend popping the meat in the freezer for at least 30-45 minutes
            to chill. Then use a sharp knife to thinly slice the meat before
            adding it to the soup.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make the broth</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, as the meat is chilling, char the onion and ginger
            (either in a skillet or under the broiler). Meanwhile, briefly toast
            the spices in a large stockpot. Then add in the onion, ginger, and
            broth. Cover and let everything simmer together for at least 30
            minutes so that all of those flavors can meld. Strain out and
            discard all of the onions, ginger and spices. Then stir in the
            remaining ingredients and season with salt.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Prep the noodles</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, as your broth is simmering, go ahead and cook the noodles
            al dente according to the package instructions. Drain in a strainer,
            then toss briefly with cold water to prevent the noodles from
            continuing to cook, and set aside. (I also recommend tossing the
            noodles with a drizzle of oil — such as sesame oil — to prevent them
            from sticking.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assemble</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once everything is ready to go, add a handful of noodles to each
            individual serving bowl, topped with your desired protein. Then
            ladle the simmering hot broth into the serving bowls, being sure to
            submerge the meat so that it will get cooked. Top with lots and lots
            of garnishes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serve</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            And serve warm, encouraging everyone to stir the garnishes into the
            soup so that they can flavor the broth, also adding in additional
            extra sauces if desired.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
